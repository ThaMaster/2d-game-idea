### Change log 2024-05-23

#### New system: The Stock Market

- First iteration of the **Stock Market** system that the player will be able to utilize in the game. This system is to be used in different locations in the game and simulate different demands which the player can exploit to gain massive amounts of resources and money.
- Each stock can be in different stock modes that changes it behaviour on the market. Each stock market *tick* makes a chance for a stock to change its mode to make it more interesting.
- Gui for the **Stock Market** system has been added. However, this is in its own frame and the user cannot at the time of writing this buy and sell stocks.

#### Changes

- Updated this readme to be of a higher standard.
- Created the *StyleManager* which will be a static class and can be accessed throughout the system. This class contains the stylings that should be used for a unified design for the fonts, colors, and such.
- Some overall refactoring of the classes has been made to make it easier to implement all this.
- Created a *HashMap* in the image loader to prevent the class from loading already loaded images.
- Created a resource file for the data of the stocks to make it easier to add new information. This may be changed if alternative methods that is better is found.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with not being able to load content from the resource folder inside the project.

#### Images

*The first prototype of the **Stock Market** system. This is in its own window at the time of writing but it will be better integrated to the main game when it is deemed to be ready.*
