### Change log 2024-05-27

#### New system: States and Entity Behaviours

- First implementation of the entity behaviours have been implemented and is showcased under the *Images* section.
- The behaviour comes from classes that extends the abstract *State* class.
- Created the *StateMachine* class that will be used to handle the changes in state.

#### Changes

---

- **Code:** Added a *Enemy* class that extends *Entity* but will later be more specified for each enemy type.
- **Code:** Created new folder that contains everything regarding animations.
- **Code:** Refactored the *Animator* class to be more scalable, now containing animation classes instead of arraylists with images. The animation now keep track on its current frame and each animation can have seperate frame delay.
- **Code:** Added a draw function to the player, making it more decoupled between the classes.
- **Code:** Changed so that the animator keeps track if the animation should be flipped or not.
- **Code:** Refactored the *GameController* class substationally.
- **Code:** Changed the *KeyHandler* class to use characters instead of key codes for readability. 

#### Bug Fixes

- **Animations:** Fixed an issue with the enemy sprites not flipping accordingly .
- **State Machine:** Fixed an issue where the animations were set to the next state, rather than the current.

#### Images

*First look at the entity behaviour system. Rather than the entity just standing still, it wanders around.*

### TODO

- **Stock Market:** Take a look at the stock modes, they maybe should have percentages such that they switch to the *right* mode. For example, *Fast Climb* have a *3%* chance to switch to *Fast Fall*.
- **Stock Market:** The East stock market panel have small white border that should not be present.
- **Stock Market:** Decide how the stocks for a market is to be selected and what information should be stored in the resource file.
- **Stock Market:** Take out the logic of creating the stock market graph to seperate function so that the *paintComponent* function does less logic.
