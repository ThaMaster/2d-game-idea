### Change log 2024-05-25

#### Changes

- **Stock Market:** Stocks can now change stockmode if its corresponding stockmode duration runs out. However, there is also a 10% chance to spontaneously change in order to make it harder to detect which mode the stock is in.
- **Stock Market:** Changed so that the starting value of a stock is randomly selected around the resting value.
- **Stock Market:** Implemented the hide button functionality. It shrinks the panel and only displays the percentage of which the stock has changed.
- **Stock Market:** Implemented the graph scaling feature, which currently can display the 10, 50 and 100 earlier values of the stocks.
- **Stock Market:** Slightly changed the styling of the stock panel, adding borders and added a scroll pane if the market contains very many stock types.
- **Stock Market:** The stock icon now is displayed at the end of the graph instead of the beginning.

- **Version Control:** Restructured the readme so that it is constructed by multiple files rather than a single one in order to make it easier to log.
- **Version Control:** Added a git hook so that these change logs are sorted where the newest one is displayed in the main readme.md file through a bash script.

#### Bug Fixes

- **Stock Market:** Fixed issue with the stock increase/decrease percentage displaying wrong values.
- **Code:** Adjusted the pom.xml file so that the java compiler compliance specifies tha correct JRE version.

### TODO

- **Stock Market:** Take a look at the stock modes, they maybe should have percentages such that they switch to the *right* mode. For example, *Fast Climb* have a *3%* chance to switch to *Fast Fall*.
- **Stock Market:** Change all stock values such that they round to two decimals to limit floating point errors.
