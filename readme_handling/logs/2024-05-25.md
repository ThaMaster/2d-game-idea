### Change log 2024-05-25

#### Changes

- **Stock Market:** Stocks can now change stockmode if its corresponding stockmode duration runs out. However, there is also a 10% chance to spontaneously change in order to make it harder to detect which mode the stock is in.
- **Stock Market:** Changed so that the starting value of a stock is randomly selected around the resting value.
- **Stock Market:** The value history graph can now contain multiple stocks at a time.
- **Stock Market:** Implemented the hide button functionality. It shrinks the panel and only displays the percentage of which the stock has changed. It also hides the value history in the main graph when the stock panel is hidden which enables one to focus on specific stocks.
- **Stock Market:** Implemented the graph scaling feature, which currently can display the 10, 50 and 100 earlier values of the stocks.
- **Stock Market:** Slightly changed the styling of the stock panel, adding borders and added a scroll pane if the market contains very many stock types.
- **Stock Market:** The stock icon now is displayed at the end of the graph instead of the beginning.
- **Stock Market:** Added two additional stocks that can appear in the stock markets. The stocks that are currently available are: **Iron**, **Gold**, and **Iron**. However, many more are planned to be added to the game.
- **Stock Market:** Changed the sprite of the **Gold** stock, it is now a gold ingot and the gold coin can be used when displaying the players currency.

- **Version Control:** Restructured the readme so that it is constructed by multiple files rather than a single one in order to make it easier to log.
- **Version Control:** Added a git hook so that these change logs are sorted where the newest one is displayed in the main readme.md file through a bash script.
