### Change log 2024-05-26

#### Changes

- **Stock Market:** The stock market now works in real time.
- **Stock Market:** The simulation of the prices in the stock market will not be constantly updated when the stock market window is closed. Instead, a variable is incremented everytime an update should've occured and used to perform the corresponding number of *ticks* when the window is later opened.

---

- **Code:** Mayor overhaul of the main loop that updates and renders the game. The *GameController* class now implements the *ActionListener* interface. Rather than using general while loop with expensive calculations, the updates occurs when a created *Timer* runs out that causes the *GameController* to run its *actionPerformed* function. This causes the performance of the game to behave much more stable but I'll need to keep an eye on it.
- **Code:** Removed the *UpdateHandler* class.

#### Bug Fixes

- **Stock Market:** Fixed a bug where the stock value history graph did not update when stocks changed values.

---

- **Code:** Fixed an issue with predefined toggled keys not working as expected.

### TODO

- **Stock Market:** Implement functionality to buy and sell stocks.
